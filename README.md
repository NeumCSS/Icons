# Icons

Icons provided by [iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/). You can view
all the icons and their licences at [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.netlify.app/). To
use a icon add `i-` to the start and replace `:` with `-`, this will for 
example switch `ic:baseline-10k` to `i-ic-baseline-10k`.

## Installation
